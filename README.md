# PI Recorder Loop (working title) 

Intended to allow users to create audio collages of their surroundings.

The application takes sound recordings when a button is held. These sounds are added to a looping audio collage, allowing the user to add sounds to create an overall image. The file is then saved as one WAV file when the program is closed
